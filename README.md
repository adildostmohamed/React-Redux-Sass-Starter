# React-Redux-Sass starter pack

This is a starter pack for building react-redux applications with support for compiling sass using webpack. This is based on the brilliant ReduxSimpleStarter from [StephenGrider](https://github.com/StephenGrider/) and I highly recommend you check out his [Udemy course on learning redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)
